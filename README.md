# kes-maps
A repo that collects together some little websites, mostly map based.  

These are hosted in Github Pages (thanks github!) so you can have a browse;

##[Scottish Slope Map](http://maps.kesterton.org.uk/slope/)
The slope map is built to help plan safe routes in avalanche conditions, inspired by the shading shown on ski touring maps in Switzerland and France.  

The shaded areas were created using OS Open Data and I built the site while I was getting to grips with Angular.js.
