<p align="left"><strong>I have included two routes from the upper
and lower sections of this river :</strong></p>

<h2 align="left"><font color="#FF0000">Route 1 :</font></h2>

<p align="left">This is more a proposed ride through the clash
woods ( FC owned ). It will last about 20+ min.depending upon how
adventurous you are. The main track is of a high quality,
although the North down from the single track ( Aultgowrie ) road
is rather steep and slippy at times, watch out for the dip at the
bottom. You can go right down to the river, although you do have
to cross the shallow stream, where the track from the road meets
and then walk along underneath the electricity pylons. You can,
instead of going on the small road joining the the main tracks,
take any of the numerous paths up the hill on the South and then
follow these - there is a pretty high chance youll get where
youre heading. This is a nice we jaunt - Sunday afternoon sort,
but watch out for folk walking their dogs as these woods are a
popular getaway. <font color="#0000EE">Park ref. NH513516</font></p>

<p align="left">Another nice ride which goes through the grounds
of a working estate. Park at the blue blob and put some money in
the donation box provided (to a local charity) should you wish.
Follow the tarmac road up and cross the bridge (with a wooden
walkway) over the river, and turning right to head back
downstream. You will pass the Orrin falls, although to view them
best you need to get off your bike and wander down to them, youll
be able to hear where they are ! In season you can see fish
leaping the falls. Once you reach the gatehouse turn right onto
the road and you are back at the start. For the more adventurous
the extended section is a tarmac road which goes all the way up
to the reservoir, a short <font color="#0000EE"></font>ride
for the views, depending how fit you are as there is a lot of
climbing involved. The first time I went up to the reservoir it
took me a good hour, although I can now do it in 20min. If you
seek an even longer cycle ( a whole day) you could follow this
track, which deteriorates to gravel although is still a good
stable surface, all the way to Erchless castle [NH4141]. From
here you could then cycle back down the glen to Beauly. I would
recommend if you were to follow this route that you plan and
choose your day carefully, especially to avoid winds which can be
much stronger on high ground. <font color="#0000EE">Park ref.
