<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Great glen cycle route has recently been created as an
off-road alternative to the VERY busy and dangerous A832 for cyclist wishing to
do the great glen (the large valley which starts at Loch Ness and runs down to
Loch Linne and the west coast.  Special paths have been laid (at great expense
to the paying bodies) connecting the existing forest paths, minor roads and
canal towpaths.  The main route is split into 9 sections, starting  at   Fort
William and leading all the way up to Drumnadrochit - or vice versa.  As I have
not yet completed the route in full the text here is extracted from the forestry
commission leaflet 'Cycling in the Forest - Great Glen', copies of which are
availiable from Tourist offices, contact Inverness tourist office by phoning +44
(0)1463 234353.  Ordnance survey Landranger maps which cover the route are
sheets 26,34 and 41.  For further details of the route phone Forest Enterprises
on +44 (0)1463 791575.  </P>

<LI>Fort William to Clunes 14 miles, easy
<P>Follow the A82(T) out of Fort William heading North, turn West onto the A830
Mallaig Road and cycle over the Blahr Mhor using the cycle track adjacent to the
road.  When you reach the canal swingbridge at Banavie take the right hand
towpath (looking North) this takes you past 'Neptunes staircase'.  You may have
an opportunity to see the lock system at work.  The canal climbs from Banavie to
its highest point on the waterway at Oich bridge.  This is a busy canal with
touring craft and commercial traffic.  When you reach Gairlichy cross the canal
bridge and turn North onto the B8005 for Clunes.  An alternative route from
Banavie to Clunes is the B8004.  Either route gives excellent views of Aonach
Mor and Ben Nevis.</P></LI>

<LI>Clunes to Laggan 9 miles, Easy
<P>This relatively flat section combining forest road and single track tarmac
road with several short but steep gradients.  It follows the north shore of Loch
Lochy passing the ruins of Glas Dhoir croft and the historic Kilfinnan
graveyard.  The steep hillsides are the territory of red deer and golden eagles.
 At Laggan follow a short section of cycle path to avoid the A82(T) and join the
Craig Liath forest road.  </P>
<P>Sections 1 and 2 have easy gradients and are an excellent diversion from the
A82(T)</P> </LI>

<LI>Laggan to Invergary 3 miles, Moderate
<P>The climb up Craig Laith forest road gives excellent views across Loch Oich
over Invergarry Castle and up the Great Glen.  The descent to the tarmac road at
Mandally will blow the cobwebs away, but take care  !  Here, turn East and cycle
500m, then turn north at the A82(T), cross the road bridge over the River Garry
and turn West on to the A87, pass the hotel and tea-room (with public toilet) to
rejoin the cycle route at the telephone box.</P></LI>

<LI>Invergarry to Oich bridge 4 miles, Moderate
<P>The route climbs quickly out of Glengarry on specially built track through
several hairpin bends.  Good views of Ben Tee and craig Liath appear as you
climb.  Look out for wildlife ranging from wood ants to red deer as the route
takes you through the forest.  At the top of the climb you pass by mature spruce
trees (planted early 1930's) before joining the forest road and the descent
towards Loch Oich.  At the end of this road turn North on to the special cycle
track.  It will take you to Oich bridge through forest all the way with many
scenic viewpoints and stopping places.  Where this section joins the A82(T),
head straight on towards the canal bridge (approximately 100m. ). </P></LI>

<LI>Oich Bridge to Fort Augustus 4 miles, Easy
<P>Take the canal towpath on the left hand bank looking North, this will take
you to the centre of fort Augustus where there are shops, pubs and toilets.</P></LI>

<LI>Fort Augustus toAllt na criche car park 1.5 miles, easy
<P>From Fort Augustus follow the A82(T) towards Inverness for 1.5 miles.  turn
North in to the forest at the Allt na Criche car park and picnic site.  There is
an opportunity to stop here and admire the views of Loch Ness, Fort Augustus and
Cherry Island.</P></LI>

<LI>Allt na Criche to Invermoriston 7miles, moderate
<P>This section is mostly undulating forest road, but with some steep slopes. 
The route takes you through huge douglas fir trees reaching up for 30m. or more.
Watch out for timber harvesting in this area and obey the signs.  Through gaps
in the trees look out for Horse Shoe Crag on the other side of the loch.  You
will see a horse shoe shape of ock and scree leading down the loch and groups of
native scots pine trees beside the burn.</P></LI>

<LI>Invermoriston to Loch Ness youth hostel 4 miles, DEMANDING
<P>The route climbs a steep corkscrew tarmac brae or hill to meet the forest
road (180m.) above.  Continue to the viewpoint at Achnaconeran where there are
panoramic views of lochs, mountains and forests.  The Glenmoriston Estate
constructed walks and viewpoints on this hill more than a  100 hundred years ago
and the slab stone seat and rock cave are remnants of this interesting era [cave
is a very cool getaway if it is a warm day ].  Care is required on the gravel
descent from this viewpoint.</P></LI>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.syha.org.uk" TARGET="_top" onmouseover="self.status='Scottish youth hostel association';return true">Loch Ness youth hostel</A> to Bark sheds 5 miles, <B>even more demanding !</B>
<A HREF="images/gglen1hires.JPG" TITLE="hi res version 45kB" TARGET="_TOP"><IMG SRC="images/gglen1.JPG" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="290" HEIGHT="190"></A>
<P>This is a very steep long climb of 300m., but don't be put off.  Take your
time and perservere because the views along this section are very spectacular,
keep your eyes peeled for Nessie !  Once you reach the top, the gradients are
gentle, leading to a gradual descent down to the A82(T) at Bark Sheds.  In times
gone by this was where bark was harvested from felled oak trees, then dries in
sheds, and the tannins extracted for the use in teh production of leather goods.
</P></LI>

<LI>(non FC text) Bark Sheds to Drumnadrochit 5 miles, single track public road
- Moderate
<P>After traversing all the gates here you arrive at a pottery at the end of a
tarred single track road.  Follow this road North and it will take you virtually
to Drumnadrochit.  Take care on the downhill here.  When you come to a T
junction with the A82 turn left over the bridge to go to Drumnadrochit.  </P></LI></OL>
