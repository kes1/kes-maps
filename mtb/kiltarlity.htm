<P>Dont need to say much on this one.  It is on a fairly stable surface, I have
 yet to measure the distances, although a round trip is very roughly 
approximately 5 miles.  The viewpoint at the transmitter is excellent, so take a
 camera.  If you start from the point on my drawing, you have a choice of two 
downhills, the first one  you cross on the way up to the transmitter (its a wide
 grey hairpin where you join it).  Or you can take the right just after leaving 
the viewpoint, this is the better one (thrillwise) the track is narrower and 
full of gulleys, so hold on.  Once you reach the road you can turn left for 
Drumnadrchit or right for Inverness.</P>
