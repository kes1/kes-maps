<P>This is a great downhill route, although you do have to climb the hill first
! Take your bike over the high fence (there is a stile) and start climbing. It
is very steep in places so pushing is a good idea for thos of us who aren't
super fit. This part of the track has been recently re-surfaced with large stone
chips and dirt on top, although the winter rains have probably washed away most
of the top layer leaving gullies.</P>

<P> Once you reach the top you can go down the
same way for a thrill, or alternatively for the sensible folk you can carry on
through the gate round to the loch. The track provides access to the loch which
is fished and well stocked. Take the gate on the left back into the woods. This
track will seem to go on a long time without getting anywhere, but it soon
starts to fall off at a gentle gradient. The track crosses a few fords, these
provide a refreshing splash in the hot summer but at any other time can be a
pain, especially if you arent careful on the slippery surface. Soon enough the
downhill bit will end and you will reach another gate. Cross it and turn left on
the road if you want to go back to a car. Park at <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">NH510471</FONT><FONT
