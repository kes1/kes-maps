<p>There is space to park a couple of cars at the start point,
although please do not block the gate. To reach it follow the
A835 from either Tore or Maryburgh, approx 2 and 5 miles
respectively. Follow the Red packed gravel path as shown on the
map for about 3/4 mile, after which you will reach a fork. You
can choose either way, I will give directions for straight on.
After another mile you will come to a clearing where a couple of
overgrown tracks break off - it is not that obvious which is
which but you want to follow the hairpin right round and stay on
the main track. Follow the track until just after the first large
puddle, where you want to take the turning on the left - just
before the small hill. You then follow this track back round to
the fork - it is pretty straightforward. The second part can get
very muddy so you might prefer to continue on the main track -
after which you will come to a T-junction with a farm road (just
after passing through another gate) turn left here and you will
come to the single track road round the corner. Follow the tarred
road down to the B9169, where again you want to turn left towards
Easter Kinkell. After about 10 min. steady cycling you will come
to a junction with the A835, if you want to return to the
starting point turn left. Otherwise right takes you to Dingwall.

<p><font color="#FF8000">NEWS</font> During summer '99 these woods
have been thinned, and as such access was restricted during the summer
months, with some trails closed. I have been unable to visit thewoods 
recently so cannot tell whether they are now open again. E-mail me from 
the comments page if you know otherwise.</p>

<p>The start point is <font color="#0000EE">NH578525</font> on
the OS Landranger sheet 26.</p>
