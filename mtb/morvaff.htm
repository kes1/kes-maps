and I would not recommend it to anyone. I have placed a
descrition of it here in case anyone would be interested in
reading it. Repeat, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AS A MOUNTAIN BIKING
ROUTE !!<font color="#000000"><img src="images/lie.GIF"

<p>In my opinion it is best to complete this route from West to
East, as it means you get the climbing over in the first couple
of hours, and the steep path up the gorge occuppied by <em>allt
grannda </em><font color="#0000FF">NH 0217</font><font
color="#000000"> would be extremely difficult to follow downhill.
Admittedly the scenery is most spectacular going from East to
West. The starting point of the off-road route is Morvich </font><font
color="#0000FF">NG 960211</font><font color="#000000"> the hill
track takes you to <em>Athnamulloch</em> </font><font
color="#0000FF">NH 133206</font><font color="#000000">. A single
ticket between Inverness and Kyle of Lochalsh (12miles N of
Morvich) will set you back approximately ï¿½15 sterling, although
it is best to check with British Rail on +44 345 48 49 50. Trains
are regular, and as they are run by Scotrail bikes travel for
free. </font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font color="#000000">Heading out of the train station at
        Kyle of Lochalsh turn right, following signs for the
        South along the A87. This road, which has recently been
        resurfaced, takes you along the coast to Morvich. It
        passes the beautiful <em>Eilean Donan </em>castle </font><font
        color="#0000FF">NG 881258</font><font color="#000000">,
        on the edge of Loch Duich. Upon reaching Morvich,
        countinue past the Caravan park and outdoor centre before
        turning right onto the track. The path is signposted as
        the Morvich to <em>Alltbeithe</em> Youth hostel, by the
        National Trust.<br>
        </font></li>
    <li><font color="#000000">Initially the path consists of a
        land rover track, which continues on a gentle climb up
        the valley to the Edinburgh University Mountaineering
        club hut, which is locked. From here the track
        deteriorates markedly to a rather dismal footpath, which
        takes you up the gorge. I would recommend that you should
        take a pair of decent walking boots for this stage, as it
        is difficult to conquer by foot, let alone with a laden
        mountain bike to cope with. Whatever you do don't just
        rely on a pair of Specialized fatboy shoes with cleats
        installed - from experience I can tell you it isn't fun!
        This climb is likely to take a number of hours, although
        the views down into the gorge can become quite
        spectacular. There are a number of stream crossings,
        which are likely to get your feet wet, so don't try and
        avoid them as it ain't worth it. The main climb in the
        route of 800ft. is contained within ~1.5 km.<br>
        </font></li>
    <li><font color="#000000">Once reaching the top of the gorge
        the track begins to become cycable, although I would
        recommend caution, and an attitude such as &quot;if I
        fell of here how far would I tumble ?&quot; as it is
        certainly not predictable. Anyone with an interest in
        glaciation will certainly find this section of the ride
        captivating, as numerous glacial features can be seen
        from the track, most notably the U-shaped valley through
        which you end up cycling.<img src="images/morvaff2.JPG"
        alt="Photo of Cyclist on track" align="right" border="1"
        hspace="5" vspace="5" width="381" height="254"></font><font
        color="#000000"><br>
        </font></li>
    <li>The surface improves considerably after passing the <em>Camban</em>
        bothy <font color="#0000FF">NH 053184</font><font
        color="#000000">, although look out for drainage channels
        running perpendicular to the track, as mentioned in the
        bothy logbook they are good for bunny hop practice. As
        you continue East the scenery becomes more subdued, with
        the peaks being more rounded and generally not as
        'immense'. It is quite cool to pass the point where the
        rivers change direction, at the start of the route they
        drain West, and then around the bothy they begin to drain
        East. Wasn't observant enough to notice exactly where,
        just remember saying, &quot;wasn't that river flowing in
        the other direction earlier ?&quot;<br>
        </font></li>
    <li><font color="#000000">Eventually, the <em>Alltbeithe</em>
        youth hostel will come into view. To reach this, however,
        there are a couple of river crossings. Take note though
        that there are bridges, but these are not immediately
        noticable, so don't go flat out across a river, just to
        notice a sturdy footbridge upon reaching the other side
        drenched. From here it is plain sailing, accross a fairly
        flat valley bottom on a track which is significantly
        better compared to previous ones. You will also pass
        numerous ruins, which are nice to look at.<br>
        </font></li>
    <li><font color="#000000">After crossing the bridge at <em>Athnamulloch</em>
        </font><font color="#0000FF">NH 134206</font><font
        color="#000000"> (watch out for the kerb going onto the
        bridge) you are pretty much into the Caledonian forest
        park. The track begins to resemble a road, and indeed it
        is only a five or six kilometers to the public road,
        although it is much better if you choose to continue
        off-road alont the South Bank of <em>Loch Beinn a'
        Mheadhoin.</em> Take caution though as this route takes
        you through an important nature reserve, as the
        Caledonian Forest habitat only exists in a few places in
        Scotland - so take litter home ! Admittedly the south
        road is more difficult as there is a little (in hindsight
        - its quite a lot at the end of a long tiring weekend,
        after having a Cereal bar for breakfast and soaked
        through to the skin by the continuous drizzle) climbing
        involved, but this <strong>IS</strong> worth it for the
        downhill towards the car Dog Falls car park</font><font
        color="#0000FF"> NH 2828 </font><font color="#000000">where
        there are toilets. Yes REAL toilets. Use them wisely as
        it is a good few miles to Cannich, and it's not so
        convenient to stop when needed.<br>
        </font></li>
    <li><font color="#000000">After the Dog falls carpark I chose
        to continue down the public road (single track), which is
        fairly twisty but nice and easy. It is likely to be
        possible to continue off-road for longer but you would
        need to check this out yourself. Once at the bottom of
        the Glen Affric road you reach the main road. Turn left
        to go up through Cannich and onto Beauly/Inverness, I
        think that right would take you to Invergarry - but don't
        hold me to that as I just guessed which direction Beauly
        was in and hoped for the best. Luckily I was right, but I
        think that is because I live in the area. You might not
        be so lucky. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font color="#000000">Well thats it, after a rather measly 25
miles I had gone from West coast to East coast(ish), it certainly
felt like a lot more. As I said before, this route is very
difficult and I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone, I doubt
that I will be doing it in the near future. I believe it is
possible to go from <em>Alltbeithe</em> to Loch Achilty, as
mentioned in the hardback book from which I originally got the
idea of this route <em>&quot;Exploring Scottish Hills, a guide
for walkers and mountain bikers&quot;</em> by Ralph Stoker, ISBN
0-7153-9806-7 published in 1991 by David &amp; Charles plc.</font></p>
