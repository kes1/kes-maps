<P>This is  a fairly easy going  flat cycle through the 5000 hectare forest
which runs down the centre of the Black isle.  The route is waymarked so
navigation is easy, you start from below the Mount Eagle TV mast which can be
seen for miles around, although it is a tad more difficult to get to, on the OS
landranger sheet the mast is at <FONT COLOR="#0000EE">NH640580</FONT>.  To get
there you can either take the first right onto a single track road after
Culbokie leaving the A9 at Duncanston, or go via Munlochy, taking the minor road
directly across from the B9161 (from the A9) then take the first left and
straight on at the crossroads.</P>
<P>Once in the woods, just follow the posts with a wee bike on them, it is
fairly well signposted.  One particular section of the route can get a bit jaggy
with gorse bushes, but this can either be avoided or just wear thick trousers. 
These woods are full of paths, so I recommend you just explore them for a day
(take some pieces).   </P>
