<p>Here are a few routes local to the Black Isle&nbsp;
<!--

<p><B>April 2008: You can now find updated and new routes on my <A HREF="http://whereskes.com/?page_id=29">new site</A> at <A HREF="http://whereskes.com/?page_id=29">http://whereskes.com/?page_id=29</A></B>.
Any routes that I have already migrated will redirect automatically.</font>-->

<p>I have mentioned places to park, however as I cycle to all these routes
myself I would recommend you do as well, it is a great way of warming up
and getting to know the countryside better.

<p>All map references are to the Ordnance survey National grid. In the
United Kingdom they are a government organisation originally set up to
map for the military, although they now provide for the public also. I
would recommend that you should purchase
<a target="_top" title="ordnance survey website" href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.gov.uk/">Ordnance
Survey</a> maps as opposed to other makes, notably those selling themselves
as 'tourist maps'. The reason for this is that they offer greater detail,
and also contain a fair amount of tourist information (camp sites, pubs
etc..). The best sheets for general use are the landranger series, identified
by their pink cover. Although expensive at &pound;5.99 a sheet (approx
200 cover the UK) they are worth it if you plan to explore an area.
