<P> For now I can only make a recommendation to visit these woods and spend
a day messing about in them, as I have not yet been able to make up a
complete route.  I must warn riders not to follow the signed singletrack footpaths
 - especially the ones close to the car park- as most people do not take kindly
to a bunch of mountain bikers screaming past them.</P>
<P> There are loads of trails in these woods, only a fraction are marked on
the maps (even the 1:25 000), so remember where you have gone so as to avoid
trekking for 3 miles through boggy woodland, like I do. </P>
<P> It is possible to enter these woods at the car park in Contin and carry
on right the way up to rogie falls (again avoid the footpaths) and even on to Loch 
Garve.  I haven't yet tried this but will be taking a look over the coming months.</P>
<P> The Contin car park is at <FONT COLOR="#0000B0">NH 453567</FONT> and the Rogie falls Car
Park is at <FONT COLOR="#0000B0">NH 442585</FONT>
